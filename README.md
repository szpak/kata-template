# Kata template

An empty Java8/Groovy single-project Gradle template for TDD Katas.

In a default configuration JUnit + Mockito + AssertJ and/or Groovy + Spock are configured.

## Quick start

Write your own code.

## Additional information 

**Please note** that this template has been designed for disposable TDD Katas only. For the "real" Gradle project template
please take a look at the generic [gradle-template](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-template).

kata-template has been written by Marcin ZajÄ…czkowski. The author can be contacted directly via email: mszpak ATT wp DOTT pl. There is also Marcin's blog available: [Solid Soft](http://blog.solidsoft.info/) - working code is not enough.
